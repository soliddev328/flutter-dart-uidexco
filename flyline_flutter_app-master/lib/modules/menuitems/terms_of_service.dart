However, there may be instances when you feel that we have not fulfilled its obligations or you may have a different type of problem or dispute that needs special attention. In those instances, we are committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution that satisfies you; however, we can only do this if we know about and understand your issue. Therefore, for any problem or dispute that you may have with us, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give FlyLine an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. In order to initiate this dispute resolution process, you must first send us a written description of your problem or dispute within thirty (30) days of the event causing the dispute by sending us an email to support@joinFlyLine.com.\nYou then agree to negotiate with FlyLine in good faith about your problem or dispute. This should lead to resolution, but if for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after FlyLine’s receipt of your written description of it, you agree to the further arbitration provisions below.\nBINDING ARBITRATION\nArbitration Proceeding. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Dallas, Texas before three arbitrators. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. CLASS ACTION AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\nExceptions to Arbitration. You and FlyLine agree that the following claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any claim seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of FlyLine’s intellectual property rights; (b) any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for claims that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.\n30-Day Right to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the address listed below. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, FlyLine also will not be bound by them.\n16. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the provision will be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term and all other provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.\n17. Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Texas without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the App shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of Texas in each case located in Dallas, Texas. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.\n18. Limitation of Time to File Claims. ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE APP MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES OTHERWISE SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.\n19. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, our Privacy Policy, and any other terms referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and FlyLine with respect to the App and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to the App.\n20. Waiver. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of that or any other right hereunder. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.\n",
